![Tailwind Theme Setup Bug](../assets/images/tailwind-bug-banner.png)

👋 **Hi everyone!**  
So I was setting up Tailwind CSS in my Django blog project using `django-tailwind` — but the very first command crashed. And yes, it wasted my time 😤

Here’s what went wrong, what I tried (that didn’t help), and what finally worked.

---

## 💥 The Problem

I ran:

```bash
python manage.py tailwind init theme
```

But it failed with this error:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'theme'
```

---

## 🧪 What I Tried (That Didn’t Help)

Since the error said it couldn’t find `theme`, I assumed maybe the app wasn't created right.

So I tried a bunch of things:

- Deleted the `tailwind` app manually
- Removed the virtual environment
- Reinstalled all Python packages
- Created the app again with a slightly different name

Nothing worked. Still the same error.

---

## 🔍 How I Realized the Real Issue

While debugging, I went into this file in my virtual environment:

```
venv\Lib\site-packages\tailwind\management\commands\tailwind.py
```

There, I found the function that handles the init command:

```python
def handle_init_command(self, **options):
```

This was the **aha! moment** 🤯

It clearly showed that the command expects `app_name` as a **keyword argument**, not a positional one. But I was running:

```bash
python manage.py tailwind init theme
```

Which was **wrong** — it passed `theme` as a positional argument, and that’s why Python was throwing this:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'theme'
```

It wasn’t about a missing package — it was just the wrong format for the command.

---

## ✅ What Finally Worked

So I re-ran the command properly using:

```bash
python manage.py tailwind init --app-name theme
```

Then I added `'theme'` to my `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

This time, no error. 🎉

---

## ⏳ What’s Next?

I haven’t run the final install step yet:

```bash
python manage.py tailwind install
```

I’ll write a follow-up post about what happens with that — since it was giving me another error (yes, error 2 is on the way 😅).

---

## 🙋‍♀️ Final Note

This issue happened on:

- 💻 Windows 11
- 🐍 Django 4.2
- ⚙️ Tailwind via `django-tailwind`
